The Square Register SDK lets you quickly and easily add support to your application for completing in-store payments using Square Register.

## Getting started

### Add the SDK to your project

#### [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)
```
platform :ios, '8.0'
pod 'SquarePointOfSaleSDK'
```

Be sure to call `pod update` and use `pod install --repo-update` to ensure you have the most recent version of the SDK installed.

#### [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)
```
github "Square/SquarePointOfSaleSDK-iOS"
```

#### Git Submodules
Checkout the submodule with `git submodule add git@github.com:Square/SquareRegisterSDK-iOS.git`, drag SquareRegisterSDK.xcodeproj to your project, and add SquareRegisterSDK as a build dependency.

#### Clone-and-Copy
You can always just clone this repository and copy the source files from the SquareRegisterSDK directory into your project, but when using this approach, you must manually keep the SDK up-to-date yourself.

## Usage
Integrating Square Register SDK into your app takes just a couple of minutes. Once you've calculated how much you'd like to charge your customer, bundle up the relevant details into an API Request.

```objc
// Replace with your app's callback URL.
NSURL *const callbackURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"your-url-scheme://myCallback"];

// Specify the amount of money to charge.
SCCMoney *const amount = [SCCMoney moneyWithAmountCents:100 currencyCode:@"USD" error:NULL];

// Note: You only need to set your client ID once, before creating your first request.
[SCCAPIRequest setClientID:@"YOUR_CLIENT_ID"];
[SCCAPIRequest requestWithCallbackURL:callbackURL
                               amount:amount
                       userInfoString:nil
                           merchantID:nil
                                notes:@"Coffee"
                           customerID:nil
                 supportedTenderTypes:SCCAPIRequestTenderTypeAll
                    clearsDefaultFees:NO
      returnAutomaticallyAfterPayment:NO
                                error:&error];
```

When you're ready to charge the customer, use our API Connection object to bring Register into the foreground to complete the payment.

```objc
[SCCAPIConnection performRequest:request error:&error];
```

Finally, implement the relevant UIApplication delegate.

```objc
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)URL options:(NSDictionary<NSString *,id> *)options;
{
    NSString *const sourceApplication = options[UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsSourceApplicationKey];
	if ([sourceApplication hasPrefix:@"com.squareup.square"]) {
        SCCAPIResponse *const response = [SCCAPIResponse responseWithResponseURL:URL error:&decodeError];
        ...
        return YES;
    }
    return NO;
}
```

You'll need to make two quick changes to your app Info.plist file, one to declare that you'll be looking for Square Register, and one declaring that Register can call you back when it's finished.

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
  <string>square-commerce-v1</string>
</array>
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
  <dict>
    <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
    <string>Editor</string>
    <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
    <string>Callback</string>
    <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
    <array>
        <string>your-url-scheme</string>
    </array>
  </dict>
</array>
```
