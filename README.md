The Square Point of Sale SDK lets you quickly and easily add support to your application for completing in-store payments using Square Point of Sale.

## Requirements
* A [Square developer account](https://squareup.com/signup?v=developers).
* Xcode 8.0 or later.
* iOS 9 or later.

It is not currently possible to process a fake credit card payment with the Point of Sale API. If you are testing your integration, you can process small card payments (as low as $1) and then [issue refunds from Square Point of Sale](https://squareup.com/help/us/en/article/5060). Please visit [squareup.com/activate](https://www.squareup.com/activate) to ensure your account is enabled for payment processing.

## Getting started

### Add the SDK to your project

#### [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)
```
platform :ios, '9.0'
pod 'SquarePointOfSaleSDK'
```

Be sure to call `pod update` and use `pod install --repo-update` to ensure you have the most recent version of the SDK installed.

#### [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)
```
github "Square/SquarePointOfSaleSDK-iOS"
```

#### Git Submodules
Checkout the submodule with `git submodule add https://github.com/square/SquarePointOfSaleSDK-iOS.git`, drag SquarePointOfSaleSDK.xcodeproj to your project, and add SquarePointOfSaleSDK as a build dependency.

-------------------------------

### Update your Info.plist

To get started with the Square Point of Sale SDK, you'll need to configure your `Info.plist` file with a few changes.

First, navigate to your project's settings in Xcode and click the "Info" tab. Under `Custom iOS Target Properties`:
1. Add a new entry with key `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes`.
2. Set the "Type" to `Array`.
3. Add the value `square-commerce-v1` to the array.

Next, create a [URL scheme](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/Inter-AppCommunication/Inter-AppCommunication.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH6-SW1) so that Square Point of Sale can re-open your app after a customer finishes a transaction. If your app already has a URL scheme, you can use that.

Finally, open the "URL Types" section and click the "+" to add a new URL type.
Set the values to the following:

Property    | Value
----------- | -----------------
Identifier  | Square
URL Schemes | *Your URL Scheme*
Role        | Editor

-------------------------------

It should look like this:

![URL Scheme](./Resources/README/url-scheme.png)

### Register your app with Square

Go to the [Square Developer Portal](https://connect.squareup.com/apps) and create a new application.

Under the `Point of Sale API` tab, add your app's [bundle identifier](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/ConfiguringYourApp/ConfiguringYourApp.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH28-SW16) and [URL scheme](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/Inter-AppCommunication/Inter-AppCommunication.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH6-SW1), then click "Save".

Get your `Application ID` from the `Credentials` tab.

## Usage

### Swift
**Import Declaration:** `import SquarePointOfSaleSDK`

```swift
// Replace with your app's URL scheme.
-let callbackURL = URL(string: <#T##YourUrlScheme://##String#>)!


// Your client ID is the same as your Square Application ID.
// Note: You only need to set your client ID once, before creating your first request.
SCCAPIRequest.setClientID(<#T##App-ID##String#>)

do {
    // Specify the amount of money to charge.
    let money = try SCCMoney(amountCents: 100, currencyCode: "USD")

    // Create the request.
    let apiRequest =
        try SCCAPIRequest(
            callbackURL: callbackURL,
            amount: money,
            userInfoString: nil,
            locationID: nil,
            notes: "Coffee",
            customerID: nil,
            supportedTenderTypes: .all,
            clearsDefaultFees: false,
            returnAutomaticallyAfterPayment: false
        )

    // Open Point of Sale to complete the payment.
    try SCCAPIConnection.perform(apiRequest)

} catch let error as NSError {
    print(error.localizedDescription)
}
```

Finally, implement the UIApplication delegate method as follows:

```swift
func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
    guard let sourceApplication = options[.sourceApplication] as? String,
        sourceApplication.hasPrefix("com.squareup.square") else {
        return false
    }

    do {
        let response = try SCCAPIResponse(responseURL: url)

        if let error = response.error {
            // Handle a failed request.
            print(error.localizedDescription)
        } else {
            // Handle a successful request.
        }

    } catch let error as NSError {
        // Handle unexpected errors.
        print(error.localizedDescription)
    }

    return true
}
```

-------------------------------

### Objective C
**Import Declaration:** `@import SquarePointOfSaleSDK;`

```objc
// Replace with your app's callback URL.
NSURL *const callbackURL = [NSURL URLWithString:<#Your URL Scheme#>];

// Specify the amount of money to charge.
SCCMoney *const amount = [SCCMoney moneyWithAmountCents:100 currencyCode:@"USD" error:NULL];

// Your client ID is the same as your Square Application ID.
// Note: You only need to set your client ID once, before creating your first request.
[SCCAPIRequest setClientID:<#Client ID#>];

SCCAPIRequest *request = [SCCAPIRequest requestWithCallbackURL:callbackURL
                                                        amount:amount
                                                userInfoString:nil
                                                    locationID:nil
                                                         notes:@"Coffee"
                                                    customerID:nil
                                          supportedTenderTypes:SCCAPIRequestTenderTypeAll
                                             clearsDefaultFees:NO
                               returnAutomaticallyAfterPayment:NO
                                                         error:&error];
```

When you're ready to charge the customer, bring Point of Sale into the foreground to complete the payment:

```objc
[SCCAPIConnection performRequest:request error:&error];
```

Finally, implement the relevant UIApplication delegate.

```objc
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)URL options:(NSDictionary<NSString *,id> *)options;
{
    NSString *const sourceApplication = options[UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsSourceApplicationKey];
    if ([sourceApplication hasPrefix:@"com.squareup.square"]) {
        SCCAPIResponse *const response = [SCCAPIResponse responseWithResponseURL:URL error:&decodeError];
        ...
        return YES;
    }
    return NO;
}
```
